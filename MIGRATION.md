## Follow-up before deleting `tacogips/nix`

- Run Neovim once, review the generated `lazy-lock.json`, and commit it.
- Apply and verify both physical hosts. Only then run `mise run nix:uninstall -- --confirm` on each host.

The old Nix garbage-collector LaunchDaemon is intentionally not recreated. It
is removed with Nix and has no purpose after migration.
